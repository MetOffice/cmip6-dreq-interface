djq is the DREQ JSON Query tool, which you should be able to install
from its setup.py.  It requires the dreqpy package from the DREQ (but
is not fussy about version) and will also need access to the DREQ
itself: you can specify location and it has a bad but currently
working default.

dqi is the DREQ Query Interface.  You do not need this to use djq.

See README(.md)s in the respective directories for more information.
