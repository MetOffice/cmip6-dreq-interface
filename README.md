# CMIP6 DREQ interfaces

`djq` is the DREQ JSON Query tool, which you should be able to install
from its `setup.py`.  It requires the `dreqPy` package from the DREQ
(but is not fussy about version), nose to run tests, and will also
need access to the a SVN checkut of the DREQ itself: you will almost
certainly need to teach it where this is.

`dqi` is the DREQ Query Interface.  You do not need this to use `djq`.

See the `README` / `README.md` files in the respective directories for
more information.
