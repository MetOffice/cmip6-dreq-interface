# `djq`: the CMIP6 Data request JSON Query tool
`djq` is a program which can be used to query the [CMIP6 data
request](w3id.org/cmip6dr) (dreq below): you can hand it requests
specifying MIPs and experiments within those MIPs and it will reply
with lists of variables.

Everything is extremely incomplete and preliminary.

See [documentation directory](doc/)

`comparisons` is some code to compare what `djq` computes with various
other sources of information: there's nothing installable here.
